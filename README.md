# REST API with ChatGPT
### The Goal: 

To create a basic REST API created with only prompts and responses from ChatGPT.

### Considerations

So far, very few tweaks have been made to the code returned by ChatGPT.

### Used Prompts

1. Initial Requirement Prompt
```
You are an experienced NodeJS developer.

Create an Express REST API with 4 endpoints that calls an almost-empty function that only executes a console.log for the moment:

- POST /meetups
- GET /meetups
- PATCH /meetups/<id>
- DELETE /meetups/<id>

Each endpoint-function should be in its proper file, to have it well-ordered.
```

2. Create Meetup Prompt

```
Modify the POST endpoint to be able to accept a payload that contains a meetup object.
A meetup object will contain the properties: id, title, summary, and address.

The id will be generated by the server, so this property will not come as input. We can use uuid/v4 to generate it.

The POST should be able to save a meetup object in a "meetups.json" file that will serve as our database.

Once saved, return the recently created object with the right http status.
```

3. Get Meetups Prompt

```
Modify the GET endpoint to be able to fetch all meetup objects from the meetups.json file
```

4. Update Meetup Prompt 

```
Modify the PATCH endpoint, it should be able to update an existing meetup according to the passed "id". 
If the meetup with the id passed does not exists, throw the proper HTTP error, otherwise update either the title, summary or address properties in the object. If is a partial object, do not override with undefined values the existent properties in the object. 

Return the updated object if successfully updated.
```

5. Delete Meetup Prompt 

```
Modify the DELETED endpoint, it should be able to delete an existing meetup object with the passed "id". 
If the meetup with the id passed does not exists, throw the proper HTTP error, otherwise delete it from meetups.json and return the recently deleted object.
```

6. Split API Routes Prompt 

```
Every modified endpoint is working fine. Now I would like to split the routes/meetups.js file to multiple files within the same folder containing only one endpoint per file. 
```

7. Validate Meetup Data Prompt
```
Update the routes to also validate incoming meetup data. 

- For the POST route: validate that the title, summary, and address fields are non-empty strings.
- For the PATCH route: validate that at least one field-value is provided (from title, summary, and address)

Give me just the updated code. Do not add any extra explanations to the response
```

8. User Authentication Prompt
```
Let's include a couple of functionalities for user authentication. 

Create two new routes, each of them in different files:
- POST /signup
- POST /login

Users should be able to signup with an email address and a password. Save users' data in a file called "users.json". The password must be hashed. 

Auth should be implemented with JWT.
```

9. Protect Routes Prompt
```
Update the code to protect the next routes: 

- POST /meetups
- PATCH /meetups
- DELETE /meetups

only requests with a valid JWT token must be able to hit these endpoints, other routes should be accessible for everyone.
```

### üëç Good things

Good results so far, but some of the responses have not been as expected.

- Beyond giving the working code. ChatGPT guided me through the project creation, new directories, files, and the `npm init` config.
- ChatGPT tells you what and how to install the dependencies needed for the project.

### üëé Bad things

- After asked for the Split of the API Routes into multiple files, the resulting code was not the expected one, the API stop working due to some misconfiguration with the endpoint routes.
- After asking for the User Authentication, ChatGPT forgot the `/meetups` route and included only the new ones.

### Improvements

- Prompt: "`What could be improved in this project? Give me a list of the main 5 enhancements`"
- Response üëç:
```
Certainly! Here are five main enhancements that could be considered for improving the project:

1. Database Integration: Instead of storing data in JSON files, consider using a database system like MongoDB or PostgreSQL. Databases provide better data management, scalability, and querying capabilities.
2. User Input Validation: Implement thorough validation for user input data. This includes validating email addresses, enforcing password complexity rules, and sanitizing user input to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
3. Error Handling and Logging: Enhance the error handling mechanism by implementing a centralized error handling middleware to catch and handle errors consistently. Additionally, implement logging to record important application events and errors, which can be useful for troubleshooting and monitoring.
4. Pagination and Filtering: If the number of meetups grows, implement pagination to fetch meetups in smaller chunks rather than all at once. Additionally, consider adding filtering options to the `GET /meetups` endpoint, allowing users to search for specific meetups based on criteria like date, location, or title.
5. API Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints, including the request/response structure, expected data formats, and authentication requirements. Tools like Swagger or OpenAPI can help generate API documentation and provide an interactive UI for testing the endpoints.

These enhancements focus on areas such as data management, security, error handling, performance, and documentation to make the project more robust, scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly.
